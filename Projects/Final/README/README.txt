Write an original assembly language program, with a .doc file for each of 
your subroutines and one for your entire project.  You may use any 
assembler you wish, including LC-3 or ARM (Raspberry Pi).

Here are the exact requirements for your program:
-Your program should behave like a high-level language program.
-Your program should have proper comments, including a header that identifies
the program, the author, and the purpose.
-It should print a welcome message.
-It should print prompts to the console screen and input values from the 
keyboard.
-Input values should be validated. If they are not valid, you should inform 
the user and prompt them to try again.
-Output the result to the console screen, along with an appropriate prompt.

Hints:
I suggest that you write a simple four-function calculator.  This will be 
sufficient for full credit.

For extra credit, write a program that you have previously written in a 
high-level language, such as Python or C++.

Break your program into subroutines. This will reduce the tedium in writing 
it. This will also make it easier to understand and to debug.

You may work on this as a team. If you do:

Each member of the team should submit an original description of the entire 
project, identifying the team members, the main file and the subroutines. 
If there are any special instructions for assembling and linking the 
project, the description should explain those as well. The project 
documentation should identify the submitterâ€™s contribution to the project. 
In addition, each team member should submit their own copy of the *.s 
and *.doc files.
